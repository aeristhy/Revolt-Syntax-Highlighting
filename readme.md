## Code Blocks

[Revolt](https://revolt.chat) also supports code blocks. You can make your own code blocks by wrapping your text in backticks (`)

| Style                          | Markdown                        |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `one line code block are nice` | \`one line code block are nice\`|

You can also use three backticks (```) to create multiline code blocks.

| Style                                       | Markdown                                         |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ```so much amazing stuff you can do here``` | \`\`\`so much amazing stuff you can do here\`\`\`|

## Supported Languages

If you really want to fancy up your code blocks, you can denote a specific language for syntax highlighting, by typing the name of the language you want the code block to expect right after the first three backticks beginning your code block. An example...

css

There are for now 4 different languages in place of Markdown that Revolt's syntax highlighting support.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: The language display, shown above in purple, also acts as a copy button: If you click on it, the entire contents of the code block get pasted into your clipboard! This is especially useful for code blocks that contain a lot of text.

javascript
